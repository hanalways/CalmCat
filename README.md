# CalmCat - A Capstone Project

## Project Overview
CalmCat is an Ada Developer's Academy C11 capstone project.

## Game Description
Anxiety, self-doubt, and stress are common every day problems that hold people back from their productivity and overall daily happiness. CalmCat targets these stressors with a series of micro-games that encourage users to self reflect, regain composure and relieve stress with the use of an accessible and streamlined iOS app. Each micro-game would implement key elements of theraputic techniques that users can begin to access in and out of app and maintain positive and uplifting attitude.
